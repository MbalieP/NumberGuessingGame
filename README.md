# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (JavaScript)

A fun little browser-based number guessing game written in vanilla JavaScript! The program randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it. After each guess, the game gives feedback — too high, too low, or correct — and counts the number of attempts.
